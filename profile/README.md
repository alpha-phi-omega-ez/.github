# Alpha Phi Omega, Epsilon Zeta Chapter
Alpha Phi Omega is an all inclusive community service fraternity. The Epsilon Zeta Chapter has been on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for 76 years, helping server the RPI students, Troy and Capital Region communities. In our campus office we run the lost and found, store backtests for students to reference, and loan chargers and calculators to students.
